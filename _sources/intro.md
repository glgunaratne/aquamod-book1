# Aquaculture Bath Treatment Modelling 

## Post-processing scripts

If you're involved in aquaculture bath treatment modeling, keep reading this Jupyter Book.   

In the following sections, you'll discover a collection of user-friendly scripts specifically designed to assist modelers in visualising and analysing bath treatments using [TUFLOWFV](https://www.tuflow.com/products/tuflow-fv/) hydrodynamic-tracer models.

For those who are familiar with using Jupyter notebooks, these resources are tailored to help you create the necessary visualisations required for technical reporting, ensuring adherence to regulatory standards in Scotland.

Let's explore how we can enhance post-processing for aquaculture dispersion modelling.

Stay tuned for more insights in the upcoming sections...
