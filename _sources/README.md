# Welcome to the Aquaculture Bath Treatment Modelling Jupyter Book!

## Post-processing scripts

If you're engaged in aquaculture bath treatment modelling, you've come to the right place. Within these pages, you'll find a collection of user-friendly scripts that are designed to help you visualise and analyse dispersal patterns.

For those with experience in using Jupyter Notebook, these notebooks are here to support you in creating the essential visualisations required for technical reporting, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards in Scotland.

Let's jump right in and explore how we can enhance post-processing for aquaculture dispersion modelling.

Make sure to explore the content pages included in this book for a more comprehensive overview.
